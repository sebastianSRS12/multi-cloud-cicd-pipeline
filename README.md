Components
The repository is logically divided into five primary directories that separate application code from infrastructure and deployment logic.

app/ 💻
Purpose: Local development of the sample Flask application and application-level files.

Key files:

 – Flask entry point.

 – Container definition.

 – Compose file for local services.

deploy/ 🛠️
Purpose: Cloud-specific helper scripts for deployment orchestration (e.g., setting up cloud-specific environment variables, invoking Terraform/Helm).

Key files:

 – AWS deployment helper.

Additional scripts for Azure and GCP under their respective directories.

helm/ ⚓
Purpose: Helm chart for deploying the Flask app to Kubernetes.

Key files:

 – Chart metadata.

 – Default values.

Templates in  – Kubernetes manifests.

terraform/ 🌍
Purpose: Terraform root configuration and reusable modules for each cloud provider.

Key files:

 – Root module.

Modules under  – Provider-specific resources (AWS, Azure, GCP, IAM, Secrets).

Policy files in  – Sentinel policies for compliance.

scripts/ ⚙️
Purpose: Helper scripts to build, test, and orchestrate the pipeline.

Key scripts:

 – Build Docker images.

 – Orchestrates CI/CD locally.

Cloud-specific deployment scripts (deploy_aws.sh, deploy_azure.sh, deploy_gcp.sh).

Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed before proceeding with installation:

Docker (≥20.10) 🐳

Docker Compose (≥2.0)

Python (≥3.9)

Terraform (≥1.5)

Git

(Optional) Kubernetes cluster access (kubectl configured) for Helm deployments

Installation
Clone the repository

Create a Python virtual environment

Quick Start: Local Development 🚀
Follow these steps to get the project's Flask application running and tested locally:

The Flask application will be available at http://localhost:5000.

The local CI/CD script orchestrates linting, testing, and image building:

Configuration
Copy the example environment file and adjust values for your cloud deployment:

Environment Variables 🔑
Usage
Run Locally 🏡
Start the Flask application and its dependencies with Docker Compose:

The app will be available at http://localhost:5000.

CI/CD Pipelines 🔄
Run the full Continuous Integration flow locally (lint, tests, build, push, Terraform plan):

Deploy to Cloud Providers 🎯
Each script uses the corresponding Terraform module and Helm chart to provision resources and deploy the application.

AWS ☁️
Azure 🔵
GCP 🟢
API Documentation 📚
The Flask API is documented using Swagger/OpenAPI. To view the generated specification, run the Flask application:

The OpenAPI JSON can be accessed at http://localhost:5000/openapi.json. For a hosted version, see the dedicated page on the documentation site.

Monitoring & Observability 👀
Prometheus – Scrapes metrics from the Flask app and infrastructure.

Grafana – Provides dashboards for key metrics like latency, error rates, and resource usage.

Logging – Centralized logs via Loki or native cloud services (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Cloud Logging).

Security 🛡️
Dependency scanning: Enable Dependabot and Snyk in GitHub to automatically scan for vulnerable dependencies.

Secret management: Store sensitive values in a dedicated secret manager such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault. Do not commit secrets to the repository.

Network hardening: Restrict security group ingress rules to trusted IP ranges. Use bastion hosts or VPN for remote access.

TLS/HTTPS: Configure the Flask application and load balancers to use TLS certificates.

Testing 🧪
Unit Tests
Run the Python unit test suite with pytest:

Integration Tests
Execute end-to-end tests that validate the full CI/CD pipeline:

Terraform Module Tests
Validate Terraform modules using Terratest (Go). Ensure Go is installed and run:

Code Quality
Enforce code style and linting with pre-commit hooks:

Documentation Site 📖
The documentation site is built using MkDocs and the Material theme.

Serve Locally

Access the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Roadmap 🗺️
Add serverless deployment options (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions).

Implement Terraform module testing with Terratest.

Expand monitoring with advanced alerting rules.

Add performance benchmark suite.

Automate release workflow with GitHub Releases.

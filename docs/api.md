# API Documentation

The Flask application provides a simple REST API. Below is a high‑level overview of the available endpoints.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Returns a welcome message. |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check endpoint returning status `OK`. |
| `GET` | `/items` | Retrieves a list of items. |
| `POST` | `/items` | Creates a new item (expects JSON payload). |
| `GET` | `/items/{id}` | Retrieves a specific item by its ID. |
| `PUT` | `/items/{id}` | Updates an existing item (expects JSON payload). |
| `DELETE` | `/items/{id}` | Deletes an item by its ID. |

## OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI (Swagger) specification can be generated by running the Flask app with the `flask-swagger-ui` dependency installed. The JSON spec is available at:

```
http://localhost:5000/openapi.json
```

You can view the interactive Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:5000/docs
```

For a full specification, refer to the generated `openapi.json` file after running the application.

## Authentication

Currently, the API does not require authentication. Future versions may introduce token‑based authentication.

## Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request** – Invalid request payload.
- **404 Not Found** – Requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Unexpected server error.

All error responses include a JSON body with an `error` field describing the issue.

## Example Request

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/items \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{"name":"Sample Item","value":42}'
```

The response will contain the newly created item with its assigned ID.
